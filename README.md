# ColorBlock
allows you to color block by clicking it with dye

*To download, go to https://github.com/prosteDeniGC/ColorBlock/releases*

### How does it work?

When you click a block that can have color, such as wool, shulker box, glass pane, etc. This block will gain color of the dye you're holding in your hand, and you will lose one dye. If you're in creative mode, you won't lose it. You also won't lose it if clicked block already has color corresponding with the dye in your hand.

### Permissions
